This is a page I made to show the Fizz Buzz problem. When the button is clicked a list of numbers will show, if the number is divides evenly into 3 "Fizz" is displayed instead of the number. If the number divides into 5 "Buzz" is displayed. If the number divides into 3 and 5 "Fizz Buzz" is displayed. If the number does not divide evenly into 3 or 5 the number is displayed.
